                        The Subs celebrate their tenth anniversary with A Decade of Dance.
                        2016 marks the tenth anniversary of The Subs: Ten years of partying,
                        touring, making friends but most of all, ten years of making music. Since 2006,
                        The Subs have become a household name in the Belgian (electronic) music scene.
                        They've released three full albums to date.

                        For their third full-length release, Belgian dance act The Subs decided to make a pop album with
                        heartfelt soul, filmic French retro-futurism and crisp beats. Hologram is an album that displays
                        many moods and styles and sees The Subs working together with both renowned international
                        vocalists and underground singers and rappers: Colonel Abrams, Selah Sue, Jean-Pierre Castaldi,
                        Jay Brown and Danny Greene. With two albums under their belt, Jeroen De Pessemier (David
                        Newtron) and Wiebe Loccufier (DJ Tonic).

                        After the success of The Face Of The Planet and Don't Stop, The Subs bring you their newest
                        single, the title-track from their album Decontrol (LL 009CD). It's a slow, sleazy & sexy song
                        that builds and builds toward its apotheosis: "We want your mad soul, we want decontrol."
                        Decontrol is backed by some amazing remixes from D.I.M., Aquarius Heaven, and Black Strobe.

                        Subculture is the debut album from Belgium electronic upstarts The Subs. With a name like The
                        Subs, you could be forgiven for thinking this three-piece is a classic punk band. Well, they are
                        rambunctious and do tear up the rule book. These beat mavericks turned the dancefloor gold in
                        2008 with Kiss My Trance, a punk-trance-juggernaut of a hit single which landed in the top 20
                        national singles chart in Belgium and their profile has just grown and grown. The Subs are
                        Jeroen De Pessemier aka Papillon (singer/producer), Wiebe Loccufier aka Tonic and Stefan Bracke
                        aka L'entrepreneur.
